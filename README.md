 🏦 Immutable Code Bank & Engineering Process

 1️⃣ Ideation & Definition Phase

- Define product goals, user personas, and safety/ESG requirements.
- Deliverables: Product Requirement Document (PRD), Architecture Diagrams, Tech Stack Decision.

 2️⃣ Repository Creation & Structure

- Centralized code bank (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) with modular sub-repos:
  ```
  kittos-smart-swimsuit/
  ├── firmware/
  │   ├── src/
  │   ├── tests/
  ├── mobile-app/
  │   ├── screens/
  │   ├── components/
  ├── backend/
  │   ├── api/
  │   ├── analytics/
  ├── docs/
  │   ├── architecture.md
  │   ├── process.md
  ├── marketing/
  │   ├── assets/
  │   ├── video-script.md
  ├── sustainability/
  │   ├── materials.md
  │   ├── esg-report.md
  └── README.md
  ```

 3️⃣ Branching & Team Coordination

- main: Production-ready
- develop: Latest development
- feature/: Individual tasks/features
- hotfix/: Urgent fixes

Immutable Policy: All changes via PRs and code reviews. History is never rewritten; traceability is guaranteed.

 4️⃣ Modular Coding, Commit, & Pull Requests

- Frequent, atomic commits with descriptive messages.
- Pull Requests for every feature/bugfix.
- Peer code reviews for quality, security, and ESG compliance.

 5️⃣ CI/CD & Automated Testing

- GitHub Actions (or similar) runs:
  - Unit, Integration, System tests
  - Linting and style checks
  - Security scans

 6️⃣ Merging, Version Tagging, & Releases

- Merge to `develop` after passing CI and review.
- Major milestones tagged (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- `main` updated for production releases.

 7️⃣ Deployment & Delivery

- Firmware: OTA updates
- Mobile App: Play Store/TestFlight
- Backend: Cloud deployment

 8️⃣ Documentation, Maintenance & ESG Tracking

- Update docs on every change (README, API, architecture, ESG report).
- Automated doc generators (Sphinx, JSDoc, Doxygen).
- ESG compliance & sustainability logs.

 9️⃣ Security, Access & Backups

- Role-based permissions.
- Scheduled encrypted backups.
- Continuous vulnerability scanning.

 🏭 Product/Process Integration Highlights

- AI-powered sensors: Machine-learned, monitor vitals, depth, time underwater.
- Auto-inflation: Inflator triggers lifejacket/buoy when abnormal signals detected.
- Sustainable materials: Recycled nylon, spandex, polyurethane, advanced polyesters.
- Documentation-first: Immutable records, process logs, and audit trails for every change.
- ESG-driven: End-to-end sustainable design, transparent supply chain reporting.

 📈 Visual Workflow (for Infographic/Diagram)

```
IDEATION → DEFINITION → REPO CREATION → BRANCHING STRATEGY
       ↓
MODULAR CODING → COMMIT & PR REVIEW → AUTOMATED TESTS
       ↓
MERGE & TAG → DEPLOYMENT → DOCUMENTATION → ESG TRACKING → SECURITY/BACKUP
```

Each arrow represents a required process gate (no skipping steps). All actions leave an immutable trace.
