1️⃣ Ideation & Definition — Detailed Procedure

Purpose

To establish a clear, shared understanding of what the product is, what it needs to achieve, and the technical/ESG boundaries before any coding or prototyping begins.

Key Actions

1.1. Define Product Vision & Goals
Describe the “why”: What problem is Kiittos solving?
Value proposition: Safety, sustainability, and style in aquatic environments.

Target users: Swimmers, athletes, children, water sports enthusiasts, ESG-conscious consumers.

1.2. Identify Functional Requirements
Safety: Detect abnormal vitals and underwater signals; auto-inflate to provide buoyancy (140–160kg).

Variants: Full cover, women’s suits, jacket-shorts, leggings, torso.
User experience: Comfortable, appealing, unobtrusive design; easy to maintain.


1.3. Outline Non-Functional (Quality) Requirements

Reliability: Fail-safe inflation, robust sensors, long battery life.
Sustainability: Use recycled/eco-friendly materials.

Compliance: Meet water safety and electronics certification standards (CE, FCC, etc.).
Security & Privacy: Protect user data collected by biosensors.

1.4. Draft High-Level Architecture
System modules:

Embedded/firmware (sensor control, inflator logic)

Mobile app (user interface, notifications)

Backend/cloud (data analytics, remote monitoring, ESG reporting)

Material stack: Nylon, spandex, polyurethane, advanced polyesters, embedded sensors.

AI/ML: Model for anomaly detection (vitals, depth, time underwater).

1.5. Identify ESG & Sustainability Objectives

Source materials with traceable recycling percentages.

Document and target carbon footprint reduction.

Plan for end-of-life recycling/reclamation of suits.


1.6. Assign Initial Roles & Stakeholders

Product Owner: Sets vision, approves requirements.

Lead Engineer(s): Hardware, embedded, software.

ESG/Sustainability Lead: Ensures compliance and traceability.

Marketing/Design: Branding and commercial messaging.

1.7. Deliverables for This Phase

Product Requirement Document (PRD) — covers all items above.
Initial architecture/system diagram.
Stakeholder and responsibility matrix.



 🏦 Immutable Code Bank & Engineering Process

 1️⃣ Ideation & Definition Phase

- Define product goals, user personas, and safety/ESG requirements.
- Deliverables: Product Requirement Document (PRD), Architecture Diagrams, Tech Stack Decision.

 2️⃣ Repository Creation & Structure

- Centralized code bank (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) with modular sub-repos:
  ```

  │   ├── video-script.md
  ├── sustainability/
  │   ├── materials.md
  │   ├── esg-report.md
  └── README.md
  ```

 3️⃣ Branching & Team Coordination

- main: Production-ready
- develop: Latest development
- feature/: Individual tasks/features
- hotfix/: Urgent fixes

Immutable Policy: All changes via PRs and code reviews. History is never rewritten; traceability is guaranteed.

 4️⃣ Modular Coding, Commit, & Pull Requests

- Frequent, atomic commits with descriptive messages.
- Pull Requests for every feature/bugfix.
- Peer code reviews for quality, security, and ESG compliance.

 5️⃣ CI/CD & Automated Testing

- GitHub Actions (or similar) runs:
  - Unit, Integration, System tests
  - Linting and style checks
  - Security scans

 6️⃣ Merging, Version Tagging, & Releases

  Merge to `develop` after passing CI and review.
  Major milestones tagged (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
  `main` updated for production releases.

 7️⃣ Deployment & Delivery

  Firmware: OTA updates
  Mobile App: Play Store/TestFlight
  Backend: Cloud deployment

 8️⃣ Documentation, Maintenance & ESG Tracking

  Update docs on every change (README, API, architecture, ESG report).
  Automated doc generators (Sphinx, JSDoc, Doxygen).
  ESG compliance & sustainability logs.

 9️⃣ Security, Access & Backups

  Role-based permissions.
  Scheduled encrypted backups.
  Continuous vulnerability scanning.
